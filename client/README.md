# Project Overview

## Project Name

PokéBinder

## Project Description

This app will allow the user to upload their favorite Pokémon cards to a virtual binder. The user will be able to add Pokémon cards, edit their Pokémon cards, and delete their Pokémon cards. This allows the user to easily share out their collection with friends, family, and ultimately, whoever they want.

## Wireframes

Upload images of your wireframes to an image hosting site or add them to an assets folder in your repo and link them here with a description of each specific wireframe.

## Component Hierarchy

Show your component hierarchy here! Use [this](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/1795/posts/30352/image/GettingStartedWithReduxTutorial-React-Component-Structure.png) as an example.

## API and Data Sample

Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your Airtable (you can find it under the API documentation) so we know you can access it and get the info you need. This **must** be properly formatted. An example is below:

```json
{
"records": [
    {
      "fields": {
        "name": "Pikachu V",
        "date": "11/2020",
        "obtained": "purchased",
        "type": "lightning",
        "description": "I got this card because I loved the determined face on Pikachu.",
        "image": "https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/cards/web/SWSH4/SWSH4_EN_170.png"
      }
    },
  ]
}'
```
